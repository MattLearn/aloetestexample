# aloe test example
example files of aloe automation for docassemble
an example file from learning how to automate docassemble interviews using aloe (A selenium offshoot)
It requires two python files and the selenium webdrivers to work.
This is only a basic example that covers:
- Feature defines the purpose of the test file
- scenario: name of test/set of action
- How to connect to a server
- How to open an interview
- How to look for text in interview
- How to click a button
- How to set input to a specific field
- How to wait/pause

# This is no longer relevant as due to dependency conflict behave is now used instead of aloe
